Instructions
1. We don't have any special instructions as the game should just run fine when someone opens the
project.

2. The UML diagrams are located in the UML_Diagrams directory in the project.

3. The games are self explanatory as the Picture Game is similar to "Where's Waldo", WarGame is
similar to the card game of War and SudokuGame is the same as Sudoku. The user can choose whichever
game they want to play and each has several levels.

4. Have fun!
